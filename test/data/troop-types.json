Effective irritants against enemy heavy foot and similar melee-focused infantry where their response of fleeing when overmatched and then regrouping and returning makes for a frustrating battle without good result for the heavy foot. Examples are Balearic slingers, Cretan archers, Medieval handgunners, and so on.",
