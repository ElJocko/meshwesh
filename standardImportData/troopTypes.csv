BLV|Bow Levy|BL|2|foot|Poorly trained infantry with long-distance missile weapons, untrained in volley fire, and smaller supplies of ammunition. Their long-range fire is weak and ineffective, and they would only use their relatively scarce supply of arrows when an enemy was quite close.  Examples are Elamite massed bowmen, Sicilio-Norman Saracen foot bow, and a wide variety of Biblical and Medieval massed archers without confidence or much training.|Bow Levy

ARC|Archers|Arc|4|foot|Infantry armed with long-distance missile weapons, trained in volley fire, and supplied with large numbers of arrows, quarrels or darts.  Examples include Medieval bow and crossbowmen, English longbow, Nabataean archers, Chinese crossbow, Japanese samurai before the Sengoku-jidai, and many others.|Archer

SKM|Skirmishers|Sk|3|foot|Loose order troops with long-range missile weapons, but used as individuals (not volley fire) and at short ranges (as close as can be done without personal risk), and with relatively limited ammo supplies. Effective irritants against enemy heavy foot and similar melee-focused infantry where their response of fleeing when overmatched and then regrouping and returning makes for a frustrating battle without good result for the heavy foot. Examples are Balearic slingers, Cretan archers, Medieval handgunners, and so on.|Skirmisher

PAV|Pavisiers|Pv|4|foot|A combination formation where a large body of long-distance missile troops are stiffened with a few front ranks of spear or pike, often with the large shield called (in the Middle Ages) a pavise, or similar. As such the formation retained the long-range missile capability of Archers, but with greater ability to hold off enemy mounted and foot. These formations were effective in good going, but performed poorly when the thin front ranks were unable to maintain close formation in bad terrain. Examples are Byzantine kontaratoi, Achaemenid Persian sparabara and the Babylonian formations they inherited from, many formations of the Chinese Warring States period, and Italian Medieval pavisiers.|Pavise
