Armies with this battle card have a camp that may be placed anywhere along the player’s base edge.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates if the Pack Trains and Herds battle card is available to an army.

This battle card cannot be used in combination with a Fortified Camp battle card.  Both battle cards may be purchased for an army, but only one may be used in a single battle.

#### Cost
1 point

#### Deployment
A player’s camp may be placed at any location along the player’s base edge. It is not limited to the center third of the game board.

The camp is placed at the same time the player’s last troops are deployed (not counting those reserved for a flank march).

Other camp placement rules still apply:
- The camp must be placed in open terrain and in contact with the player’s base edge.
- The camp may not move during the game.
- The camp may be garrisoned.

#### Game Play
All standard camp rules apply without change.

#### Historical Background
This battle card represents cases where the logistic element of an army is made up of a pack train of mules, ponies, camels, or horses; or cases where the army has
a camp with a large proportion of livestock, flocks, horse herds, or other non-static troops.

Camps of this type should be portrayed in an appropriate way.
