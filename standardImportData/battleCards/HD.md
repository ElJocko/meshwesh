#### Historical Background
Pagondas of Thebes won the battle of Delium (424 BC) through the use of unusually deep hoplite formations.  Thebans used deep formations again under Pelopidas
at Tegyra (375 BC) and under Epaminondas at Leuctra (371 BC).  Epaminondasâ€™ victory at Leuctra was immediately famous throughout the Greek-speaking world, and it 
is reasonable to allow these tactics to any hoplites after Leuctra.

Philip of Macedon was strongly influenced by these tactics in developing his own military innovations.
