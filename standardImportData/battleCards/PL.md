Troops with the Plaustrella battle card are equipped with portable anti-mounted barriers.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Plaustrella battle card purchased for them.

#### Cost
1 point per stand

#### Deployment
During deployment, any stand which has had a Plaustrella battle card purchased for it may be deployed as its normal troop type or as a Plaustrella equipped stand. The choice is made when each stand is deployed. Once deployed, the stand’s type may not be changed.

#### Modeling
A Plaustrella equipped stand is modelled using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width), and the mobile barriers depicted appropriately.

#### Game Play
A Plaustrella equipped stand has a tactical move distance of 2 MU in all terrain

A Plaustrella equipped stand is treated as a close order foot stand for all movement and combat, regardless of its original troop type

When shot at in ranged combat, a Plaustrella equipped stand:
- Has a combat factor of +3
- Receives a +1 tactical factor, unless shot at from the rear

In close combat, a Plaustrella equipped stand:
- Is treated as if its troop type is Heavy Foot
- Receives a +2 tactical factor against any mounted troop type, unless the stand is fighting to its flank or rear
- Is Shattered (destroyed if beaten) by Elephants

#### Victory Conditions
A Plaustrella equipped stand counts as 4 points of lost troops when destroyed.  A stand deployed as its normal troop type counts as its normal number of points of lost troops.

#### Historical Background
Plaustrella are man-pushed spiked carts or other mobile anti-cavalry defenses.  The name comes from devices that were used in several battles by the Communal Italians (Milan v. Frederick Barbarossa 1169 AD; battle of San Cesario Sul Panaro between Bologna and Parma 1229 AD).  Similar spiked carts were used in desperation by the Romans against Pyrrhus.  The Classical Indians called such devices rathamasaula.  Wheeled mantlets called karwah were used by the Ghurids, and there are other examples in history.

War wagons are the wrong classification for these devices.  Plaustrella are smaller, lighter, more mobile, and require no draft animals to pull them.  Further, they were not used by troops who fought primarily with missile weapons, so they would need to be brought into contact with enemy.  Our assessment is that they are tools primarily aimed at gaining an advantage against enemy mounted troops – infantry enemies would have little difficulty avoiding their spikes and would find them nearly as good a protective barrier as the guys pushing them would, so they are given no advantage in infantry-infantry fights.
