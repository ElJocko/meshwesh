Armies with this battle card may deploy eligible troops as a mounted troop type or a foot troop type. Eligible troops may also dismount (change to the foot troop type) as part of a tactical move.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have the Mid-Battle Dismounting ability. The army list specifies the troop type that those troops dismount as.

This is a battle card that is an army ability; buying this battle card gives the player the ability to use Mid- Battle Dismounting with all eligible troop entries in the
army list. For example, the Later Low Countries army list has Mid-battle Dismounting available for both its burghers (Knights or Bad Horse) and its mercenary men-at-arms (Knights) troop entries. Purchasing this battle card for a Later Low Countries army allows stands in both troop entries to use Mid-battle Dismounting.

#### Cost
2 points

An army which is eligible to purchase the Mid-Battle Dismounting battle card may choose instead to purchase the Deployment Dismounting battle card, permitting all the troop stands that would have been eligible to use Mid-Battle Dismounting are eligible to use Deployment Dismounting instead.

When assembling armies, if the mounted troop type and the foot troop type for a stand have different point values, count the stand as the larger of the two.

*Example*

If a stand of Bad Horse that dismounts as Elite Foot is used for an army that has Mid-Battle Dismounting, then the cost of the stand for purposes of army building is 4 points.

#### Deployment
During deployment, if a Mid-Battle Dismounting battle card has been purchased for an army, any stand which is eligible for Mid-Battle Dismounting may be deployed as its mounted troop type or as its foot (dismounted) troop type. The choice is made when each stand is deployed.

The stand should be based appropriately for its deployed troop type.

#### Game Play
If the generalâ€™s stand dismounts using this battle card, the stand that replaces it becomes the general for that battle.

*Tactical Movement*

During the tactical movement phase, if a Mid-Battle Dismounting card has been purchased for an army, any mounted stand which is eligible for Mid-Battle Dismounting may dismount as a single stand tactical move. To dismount, the mounted stand is exchanged for a stand of its foot troop type, placing the foot stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the mounted stand. No other movement takes place during this tactical move.

Any exchange of a mounted stand for its dismounted stand places the foot stand so the front edge is unchanged. If the dismounting stand is part of a column or group, this exchange does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group. 

A stand may not dismount if it is in contact with an enemy stand (including corner-to-corner contact).

Remounting is not allowed. Foot troop type stands, whether deployed as the foot troop type or having dismounted, may not be exchanged for a mounted stand.

*Ranged Combat*

A stand may not shoot in ranged combat if it dismounted during the tactical movement phase this turn.

#### Historical Background
Historical examples of battles where some troops demonstrably switched modes from mounted to foot combat in the middle of the battle are considerably less frequent than examples where troops could be deployed in either mode.

One such battle is the Austrians (Medieval German Princes) at the battle of Sempach, 1386 AD.
