Armies with this battle card may place obstacles in the form of additional difficult terrain.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates if the Prepared Defenses battle card is available to an army.

#### Cost
½ point for each battle card

#### Deployment
During deployment, the player may place one obstacle per Prepared Defenses battle card.

Each obstacle consists of a rectangular terrain piece, 1 MU deep and 2 MU wide.

An obstacle must be placed at the same time that center deployment troops are placed. It must be placed in open terrain in the center third of the game board and within 12 MU of the player’s base edge.

An obstacle may be placed in contact with another obstacle. If there is a gap between obstacles, that gap must be at least 4 MU in length. (The gap restrictions are intended to prevent players from artificially extending a line of obstacles by leaving small gaps between them.)

Once placed, an obstacle may not be moved.

#### Modeling
Each obstacle should be modeled as a ditch, linear obstacle of archer’s spikes, or whatever is appropriate for the army.  A separate underlying piece of felt or tape or other flat material can be useful to mark the location of the obstacle when troop stands move or fight across the obstacle.

#### Game Play
Each obstacle is treated as an area of difficult terrain. It does not block ranged combat.

#### Historical Background
Various armies were noted for making significant modifications to the battlefield in advance.  Belisarius dug ditches at Dara (530 AD).  During the Hundred Years War the English used stakes as semi-portable obstacles at Agincourt (1415 AD) and other battles.  The Ottoman Turks used stakes at the battle of Nicopolis (1396 AD).  Neo-Babylonians and Medieval Flemish (Low Countries) both used flooded ditches.  There are many other historical examples.

Obstacles should be represented on the game board in any convenient way.  In most cases such obstacles will have troop stands placed upon them at various times during the battle.

Note that Prepared Defenses tend to create longer games and static play; players should be aware of this during time-limited play, such as during a tournament or other group gaming event.

As an historical note, during the battle of Agincourt the English started behind their spikes, but when the French did not advance the English moved forward from their line.  Of course, the ploughed muddy field was still difficult terrain for the French, so they got slaughtered anyway even without the spikes.
