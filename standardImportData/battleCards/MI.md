Troops with this battle card represent infantry who increase their initial mobility by starting the battle mounted on carts, mules, camels, or horses.  When they lose 
their transport they lose this increased mobility.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Mobile Infantry battle card purchased for them.  Some army lists limit the number of stands in a troop entry that may
have this battle card purchased for them.  If no limit is specified, this battle card may be purchased for any or all of the stands in a troop entry.

#### Cost
0 points if this battle card is purchased for one stand.

1 point if this battle card is purchased for two or more stands.

#### Deployment
During deployment, any stand which has had a Mobile Infantry battle card purchased for it may be deployed as its normal troop type or as a Mobile Infantry 
stand equipped with its transports. The choice is made when each stand is deployed.

#### Modeling
A Mobile Infantry stand representing the infantry and its transports must be mounted using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width)

#### Game Play
*Tactical Movement*

A Mobile Infantry stand on its transport  is an open order stand, regardless of whether it is open order or close order without its transport.  It has a tactical move
distance of 6 MU, reduced to 3 MU if any part of their move is in or through difficult terrain.

When making a tactical move, a Mobile Infantry stand may not move within 4 MU of any enemy stand or camp. A Mobile Infantry stand that starts within 4 MU of an enemy 
stand may make a tactical move to discard its transports without moving.  

*Discarding Transports*

When making a tactical move, a Mobile Infantry stand may end its move by discarding its transports.  This exchanges the Mobile Infantry stand for a stand of its
normal troop type. When discarding its transports, place the normal troop type stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front 
edge of the Mounted Infantry stand. A stand may discard its transports at the end of any kind of tactical move, including a single stand move, a group or column move,
or a flank march.

Any exchange of a Mobile Infantry stand for its native foot stand places the foot stand so the front edge is unchanged.  If the Mobile Infantry stand is part of a column
or group, this exchange does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.

Once transports are discarded a Mobile Infantry stand is treated as its normal troop type for the remainder of the game.

Transports may not be recovered during a battle. Normal troop type stands, whether deployed as the normal troop type or having discarded their transports, may not 
be exchanged for a Mobile Infantry stand.

*Ranged Combat*

Mobile Infantry stands may not shoot during the ranged combat phase but may be shot at. If shot at, they use the combat factor for their normal troop type but 
receive a -1 tactical factor for being on transports.  If a Mobile Infantry stand is beaten in ranged combat, it must complete any required outcome move and, if 
not destroyed, immediately discard its transports (as described above).

A stand which discarded its transports during the tactical movement phase may shoot during the ranged combat phase if it meets the standard ranged combat eligibility 
rules.  If it was forced to discard its transports as a result of losing a ranged combat roll, it may not shoot in the remaining part of the ranged combat phase.

*Close Combat*
An enemy stand may move into contact with a Mobile Infantry stand and engage in close combat.  When the close combat is rolled, the Mobile Infantry stand with 
transports loses its transports (is replaced with its foot type) and receives a -1 tactical factor in that combat for being attacked while on its transports.

#### Historical Background
This battle card represents troops who sometimes began battles with additional transports to gain increased mobility, but always fought as infantry.  Such infantry
were not trained to fight mounted, but gained significant mobility while being conveyed.

Some examples of armies from history that used this ability were archers of the later Hundred Years War English, Kallapani of the Assyrians and Neo-Elamites, 
Kyrenean Greek hoplites riding on carts, and many others.
