Armies with this battle card may deploy eligible troops as a mounted troop type or a foot troop type.
#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Deployment Dismounting battle card purchased for them. The army list specifies the troop type that those troops dismount as.

This is a battle card that is an army ability; purchasing this battle card gives the player the ability to use Deployment Dismounting with all eligible troop entries in the army list. For example, the Anglo-Irish army list (before 1403) has Deployment Dismounting available for both its men-at-arms (Knights) and its hobilars (Bad Horse) troop entries. Purchasing this battle card for an Anglo-Irish army allows stands in both troop entries to use Deployment Dismounting.
#### Cost
1 point

When assembling armies, if the mounted troop type and the foot troop type for a stand have different point values, count the stand as the larger of the two.

*Example*

If a stand of Bad Horse that dismounts as Elite Foot is used for an army that has Deployment Dismounting, then the cost of the stand for purposes of army building is 4 points.
#### Deployment
During deployment, if a Deployment Dismounting battle card has been purchased for an army, any stand which is eligible for Deployment Dismounting may be deployed as its mounted troop type or as its foot (dismounted) troop type. The choice is made when each stand is deployed.

The stand should be based appropriately for its deployed troop type.
#### Game Play
The stands are treated as the troop type that was chosen at deployment.

If the generalâ€™s stand dismounts using this battle card, the stand that replaces it becomes the general for that battle.

Note that stands with the Deployment Dismounting ability may not dismount (change to the foot troop type) or remount (switch to the mounted troop type) during game play (after they are deployed).
#### Historical Background
This battle card represents the most common historical model for troops that were known to have fought either mounted or dismounted.

Some examples of armies from history that used this ability were the Hundred Years War English, Medieval French after the battle of Crecy, Medieval Germans in several battles, Mongol Conquest in a few rare battles, and many other examples from history.
