#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card applied to them.

The Charging Camelry and Armored Camelry battle cards must be applied to all of the stands in a troop entry if applied to any (i.e., all or none).

#### Cost
Reduce the cost of any stand that has the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card applied to it by 1 point.

#### Deployment
Stands which have the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card are deployed using the standard deployment rules.

#### Modeling
A stand with the Charging Camelry battle card is mounted using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width). This basing option makes it easier to fit camels in running poses, which are larger than running horses; square bases also make it easier to distinguish these troops from other Knights. A stand with the Armored Camelry battle card is already based as Cataphracts on square bases and does not require any modification.

Stands retain their original designation as open order or close order, regardless of their basing.

#### Game Play
When making a _single stand_ tactical move, stands which have the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card treat Dunes and Oasis as open terrain.

A group move composed entirely of Charging Camelry, Armored Camelry, or Light Camelry in any combination also treats Dunes and Oasis as open terrain.

In close combat, stands which have the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card receive a -1 tactical factor. If beaten but not doubled by Elephants, they must fall back rather than being shattered.

#### Victory Conditions
A stand that has the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card counts as 3 points when destroyed. 

#### Historical Background
Tuaregs used hard charging camelry (classed as Knights); they appear in large numbers in the Tuareg army and in a few other armies as mercenaries or small contingents. The Arabo-Aramaean city-state of Emesa may have used armored camelry (rated as Cataphracts). Parthia may have used them at the battle of Nisibis (217 AD).

Virtually all armies who used camels in warfare (Tuareg excepted) replaced them with horses as soon as they became available in sufficient quantity.
