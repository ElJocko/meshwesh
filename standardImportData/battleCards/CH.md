#### Historical Background
This battle card reflects the 5,000 cavalrymen in the Murong Xianbei army (mentioned as the “best archers”) who are described as chained together.  It may be that this description is a literary convention (as with the later Jurchen “guaizi ma” formation which wasn’t actually chained but was sometimes described that way), but in the case of the Murong Xianbei there is a reasonable possibility that they were actually physically chained together.  Such a restriction would prevent individual horsemen from breaking formation to engage in heroic individual combat; it would also force them to fight solely using massed archery, and it would give some resistance to enemy shock cavalry as well.

On the downside, chaining such a formation would make it awkward to move, slow it down, and reduce its effectiveness against foot skirmishers equipped with missile weapons used at close range.
