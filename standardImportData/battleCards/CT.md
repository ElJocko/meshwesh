This battle card can be played to allow eligible troops to pass through friendly close order foot stands.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have the Charge Through battle card purchased for them.

A Charge Through battle card is purchased for all stands in an eligible troop entry â€” not a particular stand.

The army list also indicates which troops may be moved through.

#### Cost
1 point for each battle card; up to a maximum of 2

#### Deployment
All standard deployment rules apply without change.

#### Game Play
Playing a Charge Through battle card allows one or more stands making a tactical move to pass through friendly close order foot stands as if they were open order foot. The moving stands may be making a single stand move, a group move, or a column move.

All other standard rules for passing through friendly stands apply.

Playing a Charge Through battle card only applies to one tactical move and its effect ends when that tactical move is over.

The battle card is expended when used and may not be used again. It should be turned upside-down or otherwise marked to indicate that it has been expended.

#### Historical Background
This battle card represents a few rare armies where an occasion of mounted forces charging through close order foot can be demonstrated.

Crusader armies at the battle of Arsuf (1191 AD) seem to have used this tactic.  Surviving military manuals of the Byzantines in the height of their power (Thematic and Nikephorian Byzantines) support their use of this battle card as well.
