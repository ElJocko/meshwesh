Troops with this battle card move and fight mounted on camels.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Light Camelry battle card applied to them.

#### Cost
None

#### Deployment
Stands which have the Light Camelry card are deployed using the standard deployment rules.

#### Modeling
A Light Camelry stand is mounted using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width) and should be modelled appropriately.  This will allow it to be
differentiated visually from other Bad Horse stands who do not have these additional abilities, so opposing players can easily differentiate stands with and without this card.

#### Game Play
Stands which have the Light Camelry battle card are treated as Bad Horse for movement, ranged combat, and close combat except as described below.

When making a single stand tactical move, stands which have the Light Camelry battle card treat Dunes and Oasis as open terrain.

A group move composed entirely of Charging Camelry, Armored Camelry, or Light Camelry in any combination also treats Dunes and Oasis as open terrain.

Stands which have the Light Camelry battle card receive a +1 tactical factor when in close combat against enemy Knights, Elephants, or Cataphracts.

This tactical factor does not apply against stands which have the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle cards.

#### Historical Background
This battle card represents camel-mounted fighters with javelins or bow.  Such combatants were usually equipped or trained poorly (and so are rated as Bad Horse) but 
had some advantages when fighting enemy close-combat oriented horsemen due to the size and unfamiliar smell of camels.

With that said, troops fighting on camels were not dominant in warfare and historically armies who had camel-mounted troops evolved toward fighting on horses as soon
as they had the money to do so and no longer depended upon the deep-desert strategic movement ability of camels.  Rating most camel troops as Bad Horse with this battle 
card reflects the impact of camel troops in history.

Small numbers of camel troops used largely for scouting in desert regions continued even for armies who converted to using horses for the majority of their mounted component.
