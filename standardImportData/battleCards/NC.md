#### Historical Background
The concept of an army logistical element that can be put at risk during a field battle is a normal part of most historical battles – but not all of them. Some armies 
had no such vulnerable camp, either because it did not exist as such (as with the Hussite army at Kutna Hora), or because it was so far behind the army as to be 
completely inaccessible to any enemy (the Mongols often fought with their logistical support component days away from the battle, as at Mohi). Not all mounted 
nomad armies lacked camps, though – the Huns at Chalons (Catalonian Fields) had a camp close enough to the battlefield that it appears as part of the description
of the events of the battle.
