Troops with this battle card fight as a specialized troop type

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have the Sword-Fighting Cavalry battle card applied to them.

The Sword-Fighting Cavalry battle card must be applied to all of the stands in a troop entry if applied to any (i.e., all or none).

#### Cost
There is no cost for the battle card itself.  However, reduce the cost of any stand that has the Sword-fighting Cavalry battle card to 3 ½  points.

#### Deployment
Stands which have the Sword-Fighting Cavalry battle card applied to them are deployed using the standard deployment rules.

#### Game Play
For all aspects of game play, treat a stand with the Sword-Fighting Cavalry battle card as if it was a stand of Bad Horse, except with the following modification:
- In close combat, the stand has a combat factor of +3 vs foot and +3 vs mounted

All other rules for Bad Horse apply, including:
- A tactical move distance of 6 MU
- In ranged combat, a combat factor of +2 when shot at
- Combat results and outcome moves as for Bad Horse

#### Victory Conditions
A stand that has the Sword-fighting Cavalry battle card counts as 3 ½  points of lost troops when destroyed.

#### Historical Background
This battle card simulates cavalry whose preferred weapons were swords.  Although they may have also used spears or lances, they did not use them as thrown weapons against enemy
close-order foot, and they did not attempt to draw enemy knights into ill-timed charges, so rating them as Javelin Cavalry is not an accurate simulation of how they fought.

Although they attempted to close with the enemy and engage them in melee, they did not have the shock impact of Knights, nor the full armor of Cataphracts, so those 
troop types are also an inaccurate simulation of how sword-armed cavalry fought.

Examples of mounted troops for whom this rule is appropriate include Kurdish cavalry in the Middle East, (fighting for themselves or as mercenaries in other armies), 
Swabian cavalry in the late Dark Ages and early Medieval Germany, and others.
