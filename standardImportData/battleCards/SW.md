Instead of having a camp, armies with this battle card may deploy a Standard Wagon.
Note that Standard is used here in the sense of flag or banner, not normal or usual.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates if the Standard Wagon battle card is available to an army.

#### Cost
None

#### Deployment
During deployment, a player may choose to place a Standard Wagon instead of a camp.

A Standard Wagon is placed at the same time that center deployment troops are placed. It must be placed in open terrain in the center third of the game board and within 8 MU of
the player’s base edge but, unlike a camp, it does not need to be placed in contact with the base edge. However, it must be placed such that its long edge is parallel to the
player’s base edge.

A Standard Wagon may be garrisoned as if it was a normal camp.

#### Modeling
A Standard Wagon has a rectangular base which is 2 MU deep and between 4 and 6 MU wide. 

#### Game Play
A foot stand which has any part of its rear edge in contact with a friendly Standard Wagon gains an advantage in combat:
- In ranged combat, an enemy stand receives a -1 tactical factor when shooting at the stand.
- In close combat, the stand receives a +1 tactical factor in close combat.

Notes on applying this advantage: 
- A stand that has its rear corner but not its rear edge in contact with a friendly Standard Wagon does not receive this advantage.
- A stand that is in rear edge contact with a friendly Standard Wagon is not considered a garrison.
- A stand that is garrisoning a Standard Wagon follows the normal camp rules; it does not receive this advantage.

In all other respects, a Standard Wagon is treated as a normal camp:
- It may not move
- It is treated as a camp for both ranged combat and close combat
- It counts as 8 points of lost troops if sacked, in addition to the point cost of any stand that was garrisoning the camp.

#### Historical Background
A variety of medieval battles involved having a static banner wagon placed forward to inspire troops to great efforts.  If the banner wagon fell to the enemy, it was
very disheartening.

Armies that used this strategy included the Feudal English fighting the Scots at the Battle of the Standard, Early Hungarian, Feudal German (City-state and Princes both),
Communal Italian throughout, and Papal Italian (where the Standard Wagon would include the Pope and his bodyguard).

It is possible that pre-medieval armies also used this concept, but the battle descriptions are often too terse to be sure.  It can be unclear, for example, whether a 
protected and venerated religious icon is back at the camp or forward in a way that is more at risk from enemy action on the field (and therefore could be represented 
as a Standard Wagon battle card).  The Later Sassanid Persians seem to have used this strategy as well, with a gilded religious standard.  Gilded religious chariots 
representing divine assistance seem to date back to the Achaemenid Persians, perhaps even the Assyrians.
