Armies with this battle card have a camp with stronger than typical defenses.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates if the Fortified Camp battle card is available to an army.

This battle card cannot be used in combination with a Pack Train and Herds battle card.  Both battle cards may be purchased for an army, but only one may be used in a single battle.

#### Cost
1 point

#### Deployment
All standard deployment rules apply without change.

#### Game Play
The player’s camp receives a +2 tactical factor in close combat. This is in addition to the camp’s normal combat factor.

All other camp rules still apply:
- The camp may be garrisoned.
- The camp may be sacked.
- A sacked camp counts as 8 points of lost troops, in addition to the point cost of any stand that was garrisoning the camp, but with no addition for the Fortified Camp battle card.

#### Historical Background
Historically some armies put a lot of time and effort into creating very well-defended camps, and others did not.  The best-known examples of fortified camps are Roman armies from Marius on, but the Medieval Germans, Ancient British, and many others also fortified their camps.

The cost of this battle card is deliberately cheaper than using a 2 point stand as a garrison, since points spent on fortifying the camp cannot be used in the field.
