Armies with this battle card may disperse bow-armed troops in support of other troops.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have the Supporting Bowmen battle card applied to them. The army list indicates which bow-armed troops may be used to support other
troops (labeled Supporting Bowmen) and which troops may be supported (labeled Supportable).

If used, the Supporting Bowmen battle card must be used in one of two ways.

*Option 1*

The Supporting Bowmen battle card must be applied to all stands in a Supportable troop entry if applied to any (i.e., all or none). If there aren’t enough stands
of Supporting Bowmen available to support all Supportable stands, then the battle card may not be used.

*Option 2*

The  Supporting Bowmen battle card may be applied to any number of stands in a Supportable troop entry. If this option is selected, every stand that has 
the Supporting Bowmen battle card applied to it must be replaced at deployment by a stand modeled with supporting bow figures.  If these separate stands 
are not available (and visually distinct from unsupported stands) this option is not allowed.

These options are selected separately for each eligible troop entry.

#### Cost
There is no cost for the battle card itself. However, one or more Supporting Bowmen stands (which are included in the total army cost) must be exchanged for 
the addition of support to the Supportable stands. 

#### Deployment
During deployment, the player may set aside Supporting Bowmen stands in exchange for adding support to the Supportable stands in the army. One stand of Supporting 
Bowmen can support as many Supportable stands as the point value of its troop type. 

The decision to use the battle card must be made when the first supported troops are placed on the game board. Supporting Bowmen stands that have been placed on 
the game board may not be exchanged.

The Supporting Bowmen stands set aside are not used during the game and do not count as lost.

*Example*

A player assembles an army that has 6 stands of Heavy Foot that are Supportable. The Supporting Bowmen stands are Skirmishers (3 points per stand). To add support 
to the heavy foot stands, the player would need to include 2 Skirmishers stands in the army, which would be exchanged (set aside) during deployment to add support 
to the Heavy Foot.

#### Modeling
No changes are required if the battle card is used “all or none” – i.e., if the choice of whether to use Supporting Bowmen or not is made for all Supportable troops
at deployment.

If the player wishes the option of using only some Supportable troop stands with Supporting Bowmen, each such stand (a “Supported” stand) is modeled with the same number 
and type of figures as a regular stand, plus one supporting bow figure standing behind the line of figures.  This Supported stand should be on the same depth base if possible.

Use of Supported stands modeled as described allows the player to vary from the “all or none” choice at deployment – to deploy some Supportable stands with Supporting Bowmen 
and some without – but does not modify the battle card in any other way.  A single Skirmisher (3pt stand) could be exchanged for providing support for three individual 
Supported stands, for example.

#### Game Play
Stands which are supported by Supporting Bowmen receive a +1 tactical factor in close combat against enemy Warband, Warriors, and all mounted troop types. This tactical 
factor only applies if the stand is fighting to its front.

#### Victory Conditions
If destroyed, a stand that has the Supporting Bowmen battle card counts as its normal number of points of lost troops. The Supporting Bowmen battle card does not change this value.

#### Historical Background
A number of armies throughout history have reacted to horsemen (and in some cases fierce infantry) by using a thin line of bowmen to support behind the main line of foot.
This line of missile troops substantially increased the effectiveness of supported foot by galling the enemy and endangering them while they were still preparing to engage.

Such supporting bowmen could also be used separately from the other foot troops, grouped together as a unit.  Whether such troops would be rated as Skirmishers, Archers, or
Bow Levy depends upon their training and equipment.
