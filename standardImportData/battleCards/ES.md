Armies with this battle card may disperse elephants across other troops as a screen.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates if the Elephant Screen battle card is available to an army. The army list indicates which Elephant troops may be used as an elephant screen 
(labeled Elephant Screen) and which troops may be screened (labeled Screenable).

An army which purchases this battle card may not include any elephant stands when assembling the army; the elephants are used in a different way. This is obligatory 
when the Elephant Screen battle card is purchased and cannot be reversed during deployment.

For example, the Hindu Indian army normally requires 2-3 stands of Elephants; if the Elephant Screen battle card is purchased, no elephant stands are taken. 

#### Cost
2 points

#### Deployment
During deployment, the player places an elephant screen marker in front of each stand which is being screened.  This shows that the stand is “Screened” and receives
the combat advantage described below.

Only stands in the front rank of a single group may be screened.  The decision to add an elephant screen marker to a stand must be made when the stand is placed.

#### Modeling
It is recommended that elephant screen markers be 2 MU wide (one base width) and ¼ to ½ MU deep.  However, size is not critical because the markers do not block movement or combat.

Another option is to use an existing Elephant stand turned sideways in front of the screened line can help both players remember what the elephant screen markers mean.

Elephant screen markers are removed under the conditions described below.  A screened stand cannot regain an elephant screen marker once it is removed.

#### Game Play
Screened stands receive a +1 tactical factor in close combat.  This tactical factor only applies if the stand is fighting to its front.

A screened stand loses its elephant screen marker under any of the following conditions:
- When making a fall back or pursuit outcome move
- After close combat against a close order troop type if fighting to its front
- When making a single stand tactical move;  the marker is removed immediately and the stand does not receive any tactical factor in any ensuing combat

Any stand that loses its screen marker no longer counts as being screened for the rest of the game.

#### Victory Conditions
Removed elephant screen markers are not included in the count of lost troops. Screened troops which are lost count their normal point cost.

#### Historical Background
Military use of elephants during the Ancient and Medieval periods happened in two distinct ways.  The first technique was where the elephants available to a 
commander were concentrated together and fought as a massed unit of elephants – a stand of Elephant troops in Triumph represents this method.

The second technique was when the army used its elephants as a thin screen across a wide frontage of the main battle line of the army, to get a combat advantage.  
This strengthened the main line of the army for the initial crush of combat.

Historically the use of elephants as a screen was common and normal.  Pyrrhus of Epirus used it fighting the Romans; Darius used it at Gaugamela against Alexander the Great, 
and there are many other examples.
