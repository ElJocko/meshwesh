Troops with this battle card may deploy men-at-arms and valets separately, rather than in a mixed formation.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Separated Valets battle card applied to them.

This card must be applied to pairs of stands.

#### Cost
None

#### Deployment
During deployment, any pair of stands which have had a Separated Valets battle card applied to them may be deployed as their normal troop types or as one stand
of Elite Foot and one stand of Javelin Cavalry. The choice is made when each such pair of stands is deployed. Once deployed, the stands’ types may not be changed.

#### Game Play
The stands are treated as the troop type that was chosen at deployment.

If the general’s stand is part of a pair of stands deployed using the Separated Valets battle card, the Elite Foot stand that results becomes the general for that battle.

#### Historical Background
Burgundian mounted troops are normally treated as Knights, comprising a mixed formation of men-at-arms and valets. This battle card represents the Burgundian practice of 
deploying their men-at-arms as foot troops (represented by the Elite Foot) while their valets remained mounted (represented by the Javelin Cavalry). The Burgundian army 
used this tactic in at least two battles in the early 15th century.
