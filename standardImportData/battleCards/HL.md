This battle card can be played to prevent eligible stands from pursuing the enemy after close combat.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Hold the Line battle card purchased for them.

A Hold the Line battle card is purchased for all stands in an eligible troop entry — not a particular stand.

#### Cost
0 points for the first Hold the Line battle card; 1 point for each subsequent card

A maximum of 3 Hold the Line battle cards may be purchased for an army.

#### Deployment
All standard deployment rules apply without change.

#### Game Play
A Hold the Line battle card may be played to nullify a pursuit outcome move. Instead of pursuing, the stand remains in place. The battle card must be played immediately after the combat result has been determined and before any other actions take place.

A Hold the Line battle card may only be played on a stand from the eligible troop entry. It may not be played on an enemy stand.

The battle card is expended when used and may not be used again. It should be turned upside-down or otherwise marked to indicate that it has been expended.

#### Historical Background
This battle card represents the control of elite troops who might be able to resist the urge to break formation when enemy troops in front of them are destroyed or break off combat.

Armies who might have this battle card include Marian Romans, Spartans, Hannibal’s veterans, and a few others with exceptional training, morale, command control, and unit cohesion.
