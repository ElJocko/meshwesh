Troops with this battle card receive an advantage due to their use of kneeling camels as barriers.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates which troops may have a Camel Protected Infantry battle card purchased for them.

#### Cost
1 point

#### Deployment
Stands which have the Camel Protected Infantry card are deployed using the standard deployment rules.

#### Modeling
A stand with the Camel Protected Infantry battle card must be mounted using a square base (i.e., one which has the same depth as its width) and should be modelled appropriately.  This will allow it to be differentiated visually from other similar stands who do not have this protection, so opposing players can easily differentiate stands with and without this card.

Stands retain their original designation as open order or close order, regardless of their basing.

#### Game Play
Stands which have the Camel Protected Infantry battle card receive a +1 tactical factor when in close combat against enemy Knights, Elephants, or Cataphracts.

This tactical factor does not apply against stands which have the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle cards.

#### Historical Background
This battle card represents infantry who were known to resist enemy mounted (especially those rated as Knights) by using their kneeling camels as a barrier of sorts â€“ a flesh shield.  In some cases, enemy horses were unwilling to get too close to camels. This was quite effective when used by the Moors against Vandal cavalry (Knights); when the Moors tried the same tactic against the Byzantines (fighting as Elite Cavalry or Horse Bow) it did not work as well.
