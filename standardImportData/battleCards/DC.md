Armies with this battle card used unusual methods to deceive enemies with respect to how their army had deployed for battle. This includes using non-combatants who are intended to appear as if they were real troops and disguising certain troops to appear as if they were a different kind of fighting troop.

Deceptive Deployment involves placing one or more fake (masquerade) stands during the deployment phase; when certain conditions are met the masquerade stands are removed or exchanged.

#### Selecting this Battle Card
The army list indicates if the Deceptive Deployment battle card may be purchased. Non-combatants disguised to look like fighting troops will have a Deceptive Deployment battle card listed for the army itself. Troops which may be disguised as another troop type will have a Deceptive Deployment battle card for the applicable troop entry.

The army list specifies what troop type to use for the masquerade stands, and what troop type they are replaced with (if any) once their deception is revealed.

#### Cost
The battle card costs 1 point for each potential removal or exchange:
- Non-combatants that are disguised as a single troop stand cost 1 point
- One stand of troops that is disguised as a single troop stand costs 1 point
- Two stands of troops that are disguised as a single stand cost 1 point
- One stand of troops that is disguised as two stands costs 1 point

All other costs are calculated using the cost of the actual troop stands that are in the army.

For example, a stand of Horde that is disguised as two stands of Pike has a total cost of 3 points (2 points for the stand of Horde and 1 point for the Deceptive Deployment battle card). Two stands of Warriors that are disguised as a single stand of Horde have a total cost of 7 points (6 points for the two stands of Warriors and 1 point for the battle card). Non-combatants that are disguised as a single stand of Horde have a cost of just 1 point (1 point for the battle card).

#### Deployment
Masquerade stands are placed during deployment as if they were the stands of the troop type that they appear to be. For example, Warriors disguised as Horde are deployed as if they were really Horde.

#### Modeling
Deceptive Deployment masquerade stands should appear in every way as a normal troop stand of the type specified in the army list.  When deploying the masquerade stand, it should be marked in some way not visible to the opposing player.  One convenient way to do that would be using a simple sticker on the bottom of the troop stand to designate which of the normal troop stands is actually the masquerade stand. 

#### Game Play
While masquerade stands are in play they are treated in all respects as the troop type they are disguised as, except as below.

The masquerade stand cannot move more than 4 MU (if it is masquerading as a mounted troop type) or 2 MU (if it is masquerading as a foot troop type).

At any point during their tactical movement phase a player may remove or exchange (as appropriate) a masquerade stand. This action is not considered a tactical move and does not cost any command points.

Remove or exchange a masquerade stand at the end of any tactical movement phase if it is within 8 MU of an enemy stand.

If one stand of troops is disguised as two stands of troops (e.g., a stand of Horde that is disguised as two stands of Pike), the two masquerade stands must be deployed and moved together, with one stand directly behind the other.

*Removing a Masquerade Stand*

When revealed, a masquerade stand that represents non-combatants is simply removed from the table. 

If the masquerade stand is part of a column or group, removing the stand does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.

*Exchanging Masquerade Stands*

When revealed, masquerade stands that represent troops disguised as another troop type are exchanged for the actual troop stands.

When exchanging a masquerade stand, place the actual troop stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the masquerade stand. 

If the masquerade stand is part of a column or group, this exchange does not modify the position of any other stands in the column or group, even if this creates gaps in the column or group.

If two stands of troops are disguised as a single stand, exchange the masquerade stand for the two actual stands by placing one stand such that its front edge is in the same location and orientation as the front edge of the masquerade stand and placing the second stand directly behind the first.

#### Historical Background
This unusual battle card crops up in a variety of circumstances.  The Murong Xianbei used a bunch of women on oxen to ride around and spread dust from bags in the air to simulate the movement of unknown forces and trick their enemies.  Both Pompey and Caesar had groups of camp followers on nags riding around to deceive enemies into believing they had larger forces of cavalry than they actually did.  Agathokles of Syracuse, fighting in Africa, took camp followers and rowers and equipped them to simulate hoplites.  In a battle in 590 AD a group of fierce Saxon warriors were given Breton clothing and even Breton haircuts to gain an advantage by misleading the Carolingian Franks into thinking they were poor Breton foot.  Other examples abound.
