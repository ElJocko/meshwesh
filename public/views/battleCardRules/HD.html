    <h4>Rules Change</h4>
    <p>
        Stands marked with this ability in the army lists gain the Rear Support ability per rule 66, as if those stands (only â€“ including other stands of that type not so noted in the army lists) were listed in 66.3.  All other parts of rule 66 are still valid.
    </p>
    <h4>Timing</h4>
    <p>
        This rule is continuous; stands so marked may use the ability throughout the game without restriction.
    </p>
    <h4>Cost</h4>
    <p>
        None.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a free army ability, so long as the other conditions are met.
