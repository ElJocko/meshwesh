        <h3>MID-BATTLE DISMOUNTING</h3>
        <h4>Rules Change</h4>
        <p>
            Certain troop types are marked in the army lists as having a mounted type and an infantry (dismounted) type.  In deployment or during the battle they may choose to switch from their mounted type to their infantry type.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they are deployed on the battlefield their owner may choose to deploy them as either their mounted or dismounted type.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a single-stand (non-group) move, the owner may dismount the stand (change it from its mounted to its infantry type).  Normal command costs apply to this move.  The front of the stand remains in place.  No other movement occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dismounting is not allowed if the stand is in overlap or combat.  Stands capable of ranged combat may not fire in the turn where they dismount.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stands may not dismount (change from mounted to infantry) at any other point in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dismounted stands may not remount (change to their mounted type) during the battle.
        </p>
        <h4>Timing</h4>
        <p>
            Stands may dismount at deployment, or as part of normal movement in a friendly movement phase, or any mixture of the two.
        </p>
        <h4>Cost</h4>
        <p>
            +1 point per stand (rounded up).  If the two stand types are different costs, the base cost (before modification) is the greater of the two costs.  For example, a stand of Bad Horse (3pts) that can dismount as Elite Foot (4pts) would cost 5 points each.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an “all or none” ability – if a given line in the army list allows the ability, it must be purchased for all such stands or for none of them.  If different lines in the same army list allow this battle card, the choice may be made separately for each line.
