    <h3>LIGHT CAMELRY</h3>
    <h4>Rules Change</h4>
    <p>
        Light Camelry fight in all respects as Bad Horse, except that they gain the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Dunes and Oasis terrain are treated as open terrain for such stands for all purposes.  Group moves across such terrain are possible only if all stands in the group can group move across Dunes and Oasis (either have this battle card, have the Charging Camelry or Armored Camelry battle card, or are Skirmishers or Rabble).
            <li>+1 in melee combat against Knights, Elephants, and Cataphracts.  This bonus does not apply when fighting Charging Camelry (rated as Knights) or Armored Camelry (rated as Cataphracts).
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Timing</h4>
    <p>
        This battle card has a continuous effect throughout the battle.
    </p>
    <h4>Cost</h4>
    <p>
        +½ point per stand (rounded down – a single stand would cost +0 pts).
